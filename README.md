# Djangular Authentication

This is a quick & dirty repo that shows code for a bare bones Angular application that invokes XHRs for registering a user, and then logging in a user.

## Setup

1. Clone this repo, and `cd` into the directory
1. `python manage.py migrate`
1. `python manage.py runserver`
1. Open your browser and hit `http://localhost:8000`
1. Click the Authenticate link
1. Click the Register button
1. If the creation of the user was successful, you will see a Hello, World! message
1. Click the Authenticate link again
1. Click the Login button
1. If the authentication of the user was successful, you will see a Hello, World! message again

That's it.
